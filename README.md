# Deep fake detection Django Application


This projects aims in detection of video deepfakes using deep learning techniques like ResNext and LSTM. We have achived deepfake detection by using transfer learning where the pretrained ResNext CNN is used to obtain a feature vector, further the LSTM layer is trained using the features.
## Requirements:

**Note :** Nvidia GPU is mandatory to run the application.
- CUDA version >= 10.0 for GPU
- GPU Compute Capability > 3.0 


Main requirements are listed below:

```
Python >= v3.6
Django >= v3.0
```

## Directory Structure

- ml_app -> Directory containing code in views.py file
- project_settings -> Contains Django settings and files to run in production
- static -> Contains all css, js and json files (for face-api)
- templates -> Template files for HTML

<b>Note:</b> Before running the project make sure you have created directories namely <strong>models, uploaded_images, uploaded_videos</strong> in the project root and that you have proper permissions to access them.



### Prerequisite
#### Step 1: Create virtualenv (optional)

`python -m venv venv`

#### Step 2: Activate virtualenv (optional)

`venv\Scripts\activate`

#### Step 3: Install requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Step 4: Copy Models

`Copy your trained model to the models folder i.e Django Application/models/`


### Step 5: Run project

`python manage.py runserver`
